	/// <summary>An entity that can be sent or received with an HTTP message.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// An entity that can be sent or received with an HTTP message.
	/// Entities can be found in some
	/// <see cref="HttpEntityEnclosingRequest">requests</see>
	/// and in
	/// <see cref="HttpResponse">responses</see>
	/// , where they are optional.
	/// <p>
	/// There are three distinct types of entities in HttpCore,
	/// depending on where their
	/// <see cref="GetContent()">content</see>
	/// originates:
	/// <ul>
	/// <li><b>streamed</b>: The content is received from a stream, or
	/// generated on the fly. In particular, this category includes
	/// entities being received from a
	/// <see cref="HttpConnection">connection</see>
	/// .
	/// <see cref="IsStreaming()">Streamed</see>
	/// entities are generally not
	/// <see cref="IsRepeatable()">repeatable</see>
	/// .
	/// </li>
	/// <li><b>self-contained</b>: The content is in memory or obtained by
	/// means that are independent from a connection or other entity.
	/// Self-contained entities are generally
	/// <see cref="IsRepeatable()">repeatable</see>
	/// .
	/// </li>
	/// <li><b>wrapping</b>: The content is obtained from another entity.
	/// </li>
	/// </ul>
	/// This distinction is important for connection management with incoming
	/// entities. For entities that are created by an application and only sent
	/// using the HTTP components framework, the difference between streamed
	/// and self-contained is of little importance. In that case, it is suggested
	/// to consider non-repeatable entities as streamed, and those that are
	/// repeatable (without a huge effort) as self-contained.
	/// </remarks>
